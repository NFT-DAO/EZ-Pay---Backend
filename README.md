# CARDANO PAYMENT API
## Description

This is the code for the EZ Pay backend system that is demonstrated by the EZ Pay front end also in this public repository.

The EZ Pay Backend was completed thanks to Cardano Catalyst funding and is available free to use and to modify.

EZ Pay offers your web application the architecture for receiving fiat and Cardano payments.

Payments from Stripe, Paypal and Venmo will require you or your company / organization to set up an account.  You will receive a transaction key
that you can insert into the code from this repository in your application.  

It should go without saying, but please do not ever post your personal account and transaction key information online.

NFT DAO does NOT have access to your personal information, this code simply saves you the time of building the api interface for payments.

We wish you all the best!
